Arch Linux Home Packages Forums Wiki GitLab Security AUR Download A simple, lightweight distribution You've reached the website for Arch Linux, a lightweight and flexible LinuxÂ® distribution that tries to Keep It Simple. Currently we have official packages optimized for the x86-64 architecture. We complement our official package sets with a community-operated package repository that grows in size and quality each and every day. Our strong community is diverse and helpful, and we pride ourselves on the range of skillsets and uses for Arch that stem from it. Please check out our forums and mailing lists to get your feet wet.

Latest News Arch Linux 2024 Leader Election Results 2024-04-15 Recently we held our leader election, and the previous Project Leader Levente "anthraxx" PolyÃ¡k ran again while no other people were nominated for the role. As per our election rules he is re-elected for a new term. The role of of the project lead within Arch Linux is connected to a few responsibilities regarding decision making (when no consensus can be reached), handling financial matters with SPI and overall project management tasks. Congratulations to Levente and all the best wishes for another successful term! ðŸ¥³ Increasing the default vm.max_map_count value 2024-04-07 The vm.max_map_count parameter will be increased from the default 65530 value to 1048576. This change should help address performance, crash or start-up issues for a number of memory intensive applications, particularly for (but not limited to) some Windows games played through Wine/Steam Proton. Overall, end users should have a smoother experience out of the box with no expressed concerns about potential downsides in the related proposal on arch-dev-public mailing list. This vm.max_map_count increase is introduced in the 2024.04.07-1 release of the filesystem package and will be effective right after the upgrade. Before upgrading, in case you are already â€¦ The xz package has been backdoored 2024-03-29 Update: To our knowledge the malicious code which was distributed via the release tarball never made it into the Arch Linux provided binaries, as the build script was configured to only inject the bad code in Debian/Fedora based package build environments. The news item below can therefore mostly be ignored. We are closely monitoring the situation and will update the package and news as neccesary. TL;DR: Upgrade your systems and container images now! As many of you may have already read (one), the upstream release tarballs for xz in version 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 contain malicious code which â€¦ mkinitcpio hook migration and early microcode 2024-03-04 With the release of mkinitcpio v38, several hooks previously provided by Arch packages have been moved to the mkinitcpio upstream project. The hooks are: systemd, udev, encrypt, sd-encrypt, lvm2 and mdadm_udev. To ensure no breakage of users' setup occurs, temporary conflicts have been introduced into the respective packages to prevent installing packages that are no longer compatible. The following packages needs to be upgraded together: mkinitcpio 38-3 systemd 255.4-2 lvm2 2.03.23-3 mdadm 4.3-2 cryptsetup 2.7.0-3 Please note that the mkinitcpio flag --microcode, and the microcode option in the preset files, has been deprecated in favour of a new â€¦ Making dbus-broker our default D-Bus daemon 2024-01-09 We are making dbus-broker our default implementation of D-Bus, for improved performance, reliability and integration with systemd. For the foreseeable future we will still support the use of dbus-daemon, the previous implementation. Pacman will ask you whether to install dbus-broker-units or dbus-daemon-units. We recommend picking the default. For a more detailed rationale, please see our RFC 25.
