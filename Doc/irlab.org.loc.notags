The Information Retrieval Lab's goal is to research in basic and applied information retrieval topics, working in close collaboration with industries to transfer its research results. The IRLab (G000494) was founded in the late nineties as part of the Department of Computer Science of the University of A CoruÃ±a. For many years, the group has been working on the development of new models and techniques to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of information retrieval systems. We aim to achieve better results for the final user optimizing the computational resources. Our activity Research The group focuses on information retrieval models; crawling and indexing techniques; efficiency on storage systems and information processing; recommender systems; distributed information retrieval techniques and specific retrieval tasks; document classification; clustering, etc. Education The members of the group teach several Computer Science graduate and post-graduate courses such as Operating Systems, Algebra, Discrete Mathematics, Software Development Tools, Software Validation and Verification or Information Retrieval. Technology Transfer The IRLab has been applying its knowledge and research results to the development of useful and innovative applications in the field of Information Retrieval and in collaboration with the CITIC, Research Center on Information and Communication Technologies. Software products This group have developed several successful software products as a result of its academic and industrial research: specific search engines (patents, news, advertisements...), web crawlers, mobile applications, distributed recommender platforms, etc. Contact Mail irlab [AT] udc [DOT] es Voice +34 881 01 1276 Fax +34 981 16 71 60 @IRLab_UDC Address Lab. 4.2 Fac.
