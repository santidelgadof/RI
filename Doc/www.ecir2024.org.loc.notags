ECIR provides an opportunity for both young and established researchers to present research papers reporting new, unpublished, and innovative research results. ECIR has traditionally had a strong student focus, and papers whose sole or main author is a postgraduate student or postdoctoral researcher are especially welcome. ECIR 2024 will be held as a physical (in-person) conference from the 24th to the 28th of March 2024 in Glasgow, Scotland.Â We expect authors, PC, and the organising committee to adhere to the ACMâ€™s Conflict of Interest Policy and the ACMâ€™s Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct.
